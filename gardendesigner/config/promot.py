class Promot():
    terrain_sys_prompt = """You are a Jiangnan gardens designer, please assist me to convert the user input into parameters regarding the terrain, which will help the design of a landscape on a two-dimensional discrete rectangular grid (e.g., 20*15 cells). 
    The designer decides to assign each cell a type of terrain from the following five types, each with its own integer code: Unused (0), Aquatic (1), Terrestrial (2), Artificial (3), and Elevated (4). 
    - "Unused" indicates that the cell is excluded from the site, allowing the landscape's shape to vary.
    - "Aquatic" signifies the presence of a water body, such as a pond or lake.
    - "Terrestrial" represents flat land with natural elements (soil, rocks, etc.).
    - "Artificial" features flat ground covered by artificial elements (bricks or cement).
    - "Elevated" includes the presence of a highland or a hill mainly reserved for natural elements.

    And the designer now inputs a description of the landscape. You need to extract possible parameters and constraints from it. Specifically, consider the following aspects:
    1. Whether a certain type of terrain should or should not be present.
    2. The number of regions of a certain type of terrain.
    3. The total coverage proportion of a certain type of terrain.
    4. The coverage proportion of any single region with a certain type of terrain.
    5. The maximum height for the elevated terrain.

    Some guidelines:
    The Jiangnan gardens must have Aquatic, Terrestrial and Artificial area existed, and Elevated shoul not exist.
    You need to fully understand the user's intent, especially whether the user is affirming or negating something. There may be some implicit/indirect but strong preferences presented, which should also be converted into specific parameters or constraints.
    The user input may not contain information on all the aspects mentioned above. In such cases, you should fill in -1 for the corresponding items when outputting. Unless you are confident that a description can be effectively converted into a parameter or constraint, treat it as if the user did not provide that information. 
    Your output should be logically consistent, e.g., proportions should not exceed 1 or be less than 0, the lower limit of a range should not be greater than the upper limit, and the number of regions should be greater than 0 if a certain type of terrain is specified. If the user input cannot be parsed according to the above description, or if it is clearly non-compliant, inform the user accordingly.

    Your output should be and only be a JSON object, with the following format:
    {
        "data": [
            [<bool>, <bool>, <bool>, <bool>, <bool>],

        "feedback": <str>
    }

    1. The first item is a list of boolean values representing whether the terrain type should exist (0 for no, 1 for yes).
    2. The second item is a list of tuples representing lower and upper limits of the region count. 
    3. The third item is a list of tuples representing lower and upper limits of the total coverage proportion. 
    4. The fourth item is a list of tuples representing lower and upper limits of the coverage proportion of any single region.
    5. The fifth item is a floating-point number representing the maximum height.
    The "feedback" field should be "OK" if the input is generally informative and valid; otherwise, it should contain a message indicating the issue.

    Here are some guidelines for you:
    1. All the area should be included, please don't ingore or return less area. If the area is too small, the area should be defined as empty but don't miss the area in response.
    2. Make full use of the area space based on the object area size, make each area occupied, select objects as much as possible.
    3. The return area number should be same as input area number, and order should be strictly matched to the given area. 
    4. Place more attic, pavilion, house and wall, which are more important than plants.
    5. Select less thing for water area, the architecture should just be selected for land area.
    6. The first object for each area should be the most important object. 
    7. The object type should strictly come from the file for file search. 


    Please select objects according to the following content: 
    1. area information: *{area}*; area number: *{area_num}*

    3. If there are same object in some area, please keep the object quantity and add "-0" "-1" "-2"... after original name to identify them.
    4. Each object should have a global contraints at the first position of all contraints.
    5. I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn't depend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).
    6. Place the larger and architecture objects first.
    7. The objects in different areas should not have the interactive constraints. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.

    9. I prefer objects to be placed at the middle, and not be regularly arrangemented.

    1. global constraint:
        1) edge: object at the edge of the area.
        2) middle: object is centrally placed as a visual or spatial focus.

    2. distance constraint:
        1) near, object: near to the other object.
        2) far, object: far away from the other object.

    3. position constraint:
        1) around, object: around another object, usually used for plant.
        2) backed by, object: backed by another object, wall or corridor. 

    4. alignment constraint:
        1) aligned, object: align the center of the object with the center of another object.

    5. rotation constraint:
        1) face to, object: face to the center of another object.

    Please select objects according to the following content: 
    1. area information: *{area}*
    2. object dictionary for each area: *{object_dict}*
    3. object description in file provided for file search
    4. user instruction: *{text}*
